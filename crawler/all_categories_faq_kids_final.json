Dolphins “echolocate” to scan their surroundings or to find food. They direct “clicks” into the surrounding water and the clicks rebound off solid objects (like logs, fish, and boats) and echo back to the dolphins. The dolphins then listen for the strength of the rebounding (returning) clicks to identify what the object is and its distance it is from them. Dolphins create all of these whistles and clicks in the there nasal passages just below their blowhole, and scientist believe the sounds may be received by fat deposits in the lower jaw which send vibrations of the echo to the middle ear and brain for processing."},{"answer":[{"br":null,"content":"I think a lot of people are confused about the difference between dolphins and porpoises.

Scientists finally concluded that, for the seeds of the calvaria tree to sprout, they needed to first be digested by the dodo bird.

Fish also don’t need as much oxygen because they are cold-blooded, so they can ‘afford’ to get their oxygen from the water. Some people boil the water for their fish tank before putting it in to get rid of chlorine, so if you do that always make sure to let the water sit out overnight so that oxygen can re-dissolve into the water, otherwise your fish will suffocate!

Menthol acts as an anesthetic, which puts it in the same category as novocaine and laughing gas. Anesthetics can muffle your nerve endings’ ability to detect pain without making you lose consciousness. Other essential oils have a similar effect on people. For example, oil of clove can help reduce minor pain in certain areas of the body and was once prescribed by dentists to soothe toothaches and sore gums. But you won’t see dentists giving peppermint Lifesavers to patients in need of root canal! That’s because the menthol in your candy is just a very mild anesthetic that acts on nerve endings in your mouth. Some of these nerve endings act as hot receptors, while others detect things that are cold. Since mint oils have the ability to put your mouth’s hot receptors to sleep by making them less sensitive to heat, the signals normally sent to the brain by your cold receptors start to stand out a lot more in comparison. The brain then interprets these signals as a cold sensation. (Talk about being in mint condition!)

You can see this amazing power firsthand with a simple experiment. First, remove any rings on your fingers and slip on a rubber glove. Then wrap your fingers around an egg and squeeze really, really hard while trying to apply equal pressure to all sides of the egg. If this demonstration is done correctly, even Arnold Schwarzenegger couldn’t crack it. Why? Because of something the egg has in common with famous works of architecture like the Pantheon in Rome, Italy. This monument has survived for nearly 2,000 years because it’s shaped like a three-dimensional arch, a domed, egg-like shape that’s one of the strongest architectural designs in the world. When an object is placed on top of it, no single point in the dome supports the entire weight; instead, the object’s heaviness is carried down along the curved walls to the dome’s wide base. This, of course, works best when you apply similar pressure to all sides of the dome. If your egg breaks, it’s most likely because one of your fingers applied greater pressure to the shell than the others.\n"},"Many scientists also believe that the egg is shaped the way it is because this enables it to roll in a circular path along its most pointed end (which really comes in handy for birds laying eggs in high places; there’s far less danger of the egg rolling out of its nest). Additionally, the ovoid shape is probably a lot more comfortable for a bird to lay than, say, a sphere or a cylinder.

If you still frown on browning, though, try squeezing a bit of lemon juice on your fruit. The vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in the lemon acts as an antioxidant–a food additive that slows down the reaction between the substances in the fruit and the oxygen in the air. As a result, the lemon juice helps prevent browning and preserves the taste and color of the fruit. Bakers give this sour substance their vote of confidence by using it in recipes for apple pie; this ensures that the apples look every bit as good as they taste."]},{"question":"What is Jello made of?","answer":"Jell-O consists of four main ingredients: gelatin, water, artificial sweetener, and food coloring.

For example, the closest star to Earth, besides our sun, is about 24,000,000,000,000 miles (38,000,000,000,000 kilometers) away. There are stars and planets that are billions of times farther away than even that, and when you start talking about those kinds of distances, a mile or kilometer just isn’t a practical unit because the numbers are just too big.

Together, baking soda and vinegar just produce a lot of gas. The two things together give off carbon dioxide, the gas. This makes the bubbles. The stuff in vinegar that makes it smell sharp is called acetic acid. The chemical name for baking soda is sodium bicarbonate. These two things, when mixed, make carbonic acid. Carbonic acid doesn’t like to stick around, and quickly converts itself into carbon dioxide plus water. Then the carbon dioxide escapes into the air (the bubbles), because gases are so light, and you are left with water. A true explosion would give off heat.

When a golf ball is hit into the air, the dimples generate a thin layer of slow-moving air that reduces drag. Professional golf associations don’t standardize dimples, so manufacturers make balls with different numbers, sizes, shapes, and patterns of dimples. Golf balls can have dimples that are shallow, deep, sharp edged, large, or small. Some golf balls have multiple sizes of dimples on the same ball, and dimples can be circular, oval, teardrop, or even hexagon shaped. Golf balls have between 300 and 500 dimples, and the most common number is 392 dimples on a ball."},{"question":"What is the sweet spot of a baseball bat?","answer":"When the bat hits a ball, the bat vibrates. The vibrations travel in waves up and down the bat. At one point on the bat, the waves cancel each other out — that point is the sweet spot.

In England, there were two types of football: rugby football and association football. The slang term for rugby football was “rugger,” and the slang for association football was “assoc.” The word “assoc” gradually evolved into “soccer,” which was much easier to say. When association football was introduced to North America, gridiron football (the type played by the NFL and in the Super Bowl) was already well established. To avoid confusion, Americans adopted the British nickname “soccer” for the new sport."},{"question":"How does a hot air balloon work?","answer":"The basic principle of ballooning is simple: Warm air rises. If warm air is contained in a lightweight bag it will rise until the temperature of the air inside the bag matches the air outside. As the air cools, the bag starts to descend. These days touring balloons carry propane tanks (burners) in the basket or gondola to control heating the air. They are equipped with an instrument panel with a compass, altimeter, fuel gauge, and more. This makes modern balloon rides safe and comfortable, although the burner does get warm and rather loud at times."},{"question":"Who invented baseball?","answer":"Baseball doesn’t have one single inventor, and if someone tells you that a man named Abner Doubleday invented baseball, feel free to tell them that they are full of horsefeathers!

An NBA basketball is made of composite leather, a synthetic material designed to withstand slam dunks and allow all-stars like Kobe Bryant to keep a good grip as they go for the ally-oop! WNBA balls are also made of composites but are slightly smaller because female players tend to have smaller hands. High school and college stars use real leather balls sometimes.

For example, the Indian Ocean is divided in two by the country of India, forming the Arabian Sea on one side and the Bay of Bengal on the other."},{"question":"Why is the ocean salty?","answer":"It is salty because it has a lot of salt in it! Salt is a mineral that is found in soil and rocks, too. Flowing water picks up some salt and carries it to rivers. Rivers carry it to seas. Since this has been happening for millions of years, the oceans now have a lot of salt — about one cup per gallon!"},{"question":"Why is the ocean blue?","answer":"Believe it or not, no one is really sure why the ocean is blue! As you may know, sunlight, or “white” light, is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow. Since ocean water doesn’t absorb blue light, that light is reflected outwards when sunlight hits it. So the ocean looks blue. Another theory is that suspended matter in the water, like silt or algae, turns it blue."},{"question":"How can plants deep in the ocean grow without sunlight?","answer":"Good question! Sunlight can penetrate the ocean to a depth of about 600 feet. This is called the “euphotic zone.” Ninety percent of ocean life lives here, including ALL the ocean plants. Below that, there isn’t enough sunlight for photosynthesis, so plants can’t grow. The animals that live down that deep are some of the most unusual on Earth. There are the ones who “glow in the dark,” for instance. And of course, they cannot be vegetarians – no plants!"},{"question":"Why is the ocean salty but rivers aren't?","answer":"As rivers run toward the ocean, they pick up salt and other minerals from the rocks and sand they pass by. The rivers’ waters are constantly being replenished by fresh water from rain and springs so they don’t taste salty, but the water in the ocean collects all of the salt and minerals from all of the rivers. Minerals from the ocean’s floor also dissolve into the water and add to the salinity, or salt content, of the sea. Oceans average about one cup of salt per gallon of water."},{"question":"Why do seashells sound like the ocean when you hold them next to your ear?","answer":"When you put a seashell up to your ear, what you hear is not the ocean. The sound comes from inside your own ear. The inner part of your ear, the part that is far back into your head, has both bone parts and soft tissue parts. In between these is your cochlea, which is a tiny organ that looks like a snail’s shell. Your cochlea is filled with fluid. This fluid helps you transmit sounds from your ear drum to your brain. And it sloshes around like waves. We don’t usually hear this sound because it is so quiet.

Then your blood cells sense that the balance is wrong, so they send out their water to dilute it. They may also send out some of their important chemicals to balance out the chemical charge of the salt ions (sodium++ for instance). Well, this is just too much – the cells get dehydrated.

This means that they heat up easily during the day, and cool down quickly during the night. If the entire Earth was like that, it would be very hard for life to exist due to the extreme temperature differences that would occur. Luckily, the oceans come to the rescue. Water has an abnormally high heat capacity, and so heats up slowly during the day, and releases that heat slowly during the night. This makes for fairly constant temperatures, which help regulate the climate to keep it stable."},{"question":"Why do you see the lightning before you hear the thunder?","answer":"The reason we almost always see the lightning before hearing the thunder is because light travels much faster than sound. Thunder and lightning happen in the same place at about the same time. In fact, the lightning produces the thunder. When lightning occurs, the nearby air becomes very hot and expands quickly, causing an explosion. The sound of thunder is really the sound of this explosion."},{"question":"How does hail form?","answer":"Hail stones start as water drops. A strong wind updraft blows the drops up above the freezing level in the clouds and the drops freeze. When they get heavy enough, they fall. When they fall, one of three things can happen; the hail stone will melt and fall as rain, the hail stone won’t melt and will fall as a hail stone or the updraft will be strong enough to blow the hailstone back above the freezing level and the stone will get bigger."},{"question":"How is snow made?","answer":[{"br":null,"content":"Snowflakes are extremely beautiful objects and it is amazing that such patterns form randomly. However, that is just how they form. As you probably know, a cloud is just water vapor (steam, if you like), and is composed of very tiny water drops. Now, because the cloud is high in the sky, where the air is thin, these water droplets get cold, below the freezing point of water. It turns out that absolutely pure water won’t freeze by itself, even if you get below 32 degrees F, or 0 degrees C (though it will freeze on its own if you get it extremely cold). Instead, the water drops need to stick to something else, like a particle of dust. This is called a “seed”. Only then does the water droplet freeze. Once this has happened, other water droplets will stick to the newly made ice-crystal, and also freeze, making it larger. Depending on the conditions, different shaped crystals will grow.\n"},"In general, we see that snowflakes have a six-sided symmetry. This is because of the shape of a water molecule (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom stuck together), the angle between the two hydrogen atoms is about 120 degrees.

But I have a feeling you are looking for a more complex explanation. So here goes: All the processes in your body require energy. This energy is made inside your cells and is in the form of a molecule called ATP. Just about everything takes ATP. It is used to break food down into nutrients, for growth, for brain function, for damage repair – all the things that keep you alive. Your cells are constantly making and using ATP. The way that it is made is through a long chemical pathway in which electrons get passed around. Oxygen is the last electron acceptor! So without oxygen, your body cannot make any ATP.

People starting giving eggs as gifts for Easter because eggs used to be forbidden during Lent (the 40 days of fasting before Easter). To dress up the gift, people decorated the eggs. Painting eggs in bright colors represented spring. In Greece, people paint eggs crimson red in honor of the blood of Christ. In parts of Germany and Austria, people prefer eggs painted green. Slavic peoples decorate eggs with gold and silver. Armenians decorate hollow eggs with Christian images."},{"question":"Why do people put up Christmas trees at Christmas?","answer":"Since before Christmas existed, people used plants that stay green all year to decorate their homes in the winter. Hanging evergreen boughs over a door was a reminder of springtime during the cold, dark winter. But it wasn’t until the 16th century in Germany that Christians started using trees as decorations around Christmas. German settlers in Pennsylvania brought the first Christmas trees to America in the late 1700s, but they weren’t common until after 1834. That’s when Prince Albert, the German husband of Britain’s Queen Victoria, first brought a Christmas tree to Windsor Castle. The royal family was very popular, so many people wanted to have a Christmas tree like the royals — even Americans! The idea stuck, and people have decorated trees at Christmas ever since."},{"question":"Why is Thanksgiving celebrated when it is?","answer":"The original harvest celebration of the Pilgrims happened in the autumn of 1621 to celebrate the colony’s first successful year. President George Washington proclaimed the first national day of thanksgiving in 1789, but it was president Abraham Lincoln who officially declared the last Thursday in November Thanksgiving, beginning in 1863. It was during the Civil War, and Lincoln’s proclamation advised people to make this holiday a special time for family, religion, and community. Much later, President Franklin Roosevelt moved Thanksgiving to the third Thursday of November to create a longer Christmas shopping season. But in 1941, Congress made Thanksgiving fall on the fourth Thursday in November, and it’s been that way ever since!"},{"question":"How was Valentine's Day invented?","answer":"It’s hard to say exactly how or when Valentine’s Day first started. Some say it began as an ancient Roman festival called Lupercalia, which took place in February and included rituals to pair up young men and women. As the Roman Empire converted to Christianity, some old festivals were converted to Christian holidays. Around the year 270, a priest named Valentine secretly married couples against the emperor’s orders, and, as a result, he was jailed and died on February 14th. In honor of this priest, the Pope named February 14 as St. Valentine’s Day. In Medieval Europe, people began sending love notes on Valentine’s Day, and that’s how Valentine cards started."},{"answer":"Halloween started several thousand years ago with the Ancient Celts (a group of pre-Christian mystics who worshipped nature). They considered October 31st the end of the year and they threw a big party which was known as Samhain. It was a celebration of the autumn harvest and the Celtic new year, when they believed spirits could come back and visit with living relatives. Celts put out food and drink for the dead and left their windows, doors, and gates unlocked to give the spirits free passage into their homes. Some people believed if you left “treats” on the front porch for the spirits and ghosts, this would make them happy and they would not hurt you. Later, as Christianity spread, November 1st became a religious holiday known as All Saints’ Day. The prayer that was said on this day was called Allhallowmas. The night before became known as All Hakkiwe’en, or Halloween.","question":"How did Halloween start?"}]}]
